Unfortunately due to buggy occurences in our previous code, we released a demo version that maps out drug oversdoses over a 15 year period that includes demographic filtering; however, we are working on a better real-time implementation of the software and are looking forward to mapping out drug trafficking routes using dashed and full lines to indicate the intermittences or lackthereof certain drug trades. 
We also plan on incorporating the machine learning algorithm and predictive analytics to model future drug tafficking routes visually represent the distribution of certain drugs within different cities over time.
